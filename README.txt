## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using the provided commands.

COMMAND :
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yellowbrick kneed plotly pyyaml

The following libraries will be installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (for StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, PCA, KMeans)
yellowbrick (for KElbowVisualizer)
kneed (for KneeLocator)
plotly
yaml
argparse

2. Start a jupyter server and include the following files in the server path:

            A.	CLUSTERING AND RECOMMDATION.ipynb :
		This files contains the necessary code to produce the results of clustering and recommdations

           B.	DENDOGRAMS.ipynb:
		This file contains the necessary code to produce the results of dendograms

           C.	VISUALISATION.ipynb: 
		This file contains the necessary code to produce the results of visualisation

          D.	Spotify_Dataset_V3.csv:
		This is the input data set provided for the mini-project. Ensure that this file is in same path as jupyter notebooks.

          E.	NOTE : The jupyter files were kept separate as the files DENDOGRAMS.ipynb  & VISUALISATION.ipynb files take a longer time to run due to computational load.

              DENDOGRAMS.ipynb - 10-15 Minutes
              VISUALISATION.ipynb â€“ 30-35 Minutes

 
3. Execute all cells in each notebook. The files are independent and can be run separately.
